Fork of mosirnik/VRGIN that works with OpenXR, meaning it can run in recent versions of Unity (specifically 2018.x and 2019.x, it's used in the KKS_VR mod).

This is based on a decompiled fork that I've found that had no available source code. I don't know who the original author of the OpenXR port is.
